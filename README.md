# Network Inference Ensemble
Stacking ensemble for gene regulatory network inference. Datasets from four species/scenarios are presented here: DREAM chanllenges, Arabidopsis, B.subtilis and human embryonic stem cells(hESC).
Training/testing data for Arabidopsis and B.subtilis networks can be found in this Google Drive link and is needed to replicate corresponding experiments:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18sG4BgfYxMyAYyB1T4UY1QZyGWi1DAdo?usp=sharing
